# Resume2026
# I’m an IT Project Manager / Technical PM focused on network infrastructure, migrations, and Agile delivery. I work best in fast-paced environments where there’s a lot moving at once and someone needs to bring structure, clarity, and a real plan.

My background includes network infrastructure projects, data migrations, onboarding, and SaaS rollouts. I’ve delivered 20+ projects end-to-end, coordinating across multiple teams and keeping stakeholders aligned from kickoff through delivery. I also enjoy improving how teams work by building tracking, reporting, and documentation that make delivery smoother and more predictable.

I’m comfortable owning scope, schedule, and budget, and partnering with technical teams to drive execution. I work in Agile/SDLC environments and I’m hands-on with tools like Jira/Asana/ClickUp, Slack, and Excel-based reporting.

I started my career in healthcare, which sharpened my attention to detail and strengthened how I communicate under pressure. That foundation has carried into my work leading cross-functional teams and delivering measurable results.

I’m open to IT Project Manager, Technical Project Manager, Implementation PM, and Infrastructure PM opportunities. If you’re hiring for a role like that, I’d love to connect.
